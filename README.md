# OAlienO's Blog Source Code

Personal site can only be built from `master` branch ( [See this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39978856/unable-to-change-source-branch-in-github-pages) )  
So I commit the source code to `source` branch  
And use `mkdocs gh-deploy -b master` to push the site to `master` branch
